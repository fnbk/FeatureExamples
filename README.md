# Feature Examples

**Behavior-Driven Development** (BDD) is an Agile software development process that encourages collaboration between developers, QA and business participants in a software project.

The **Three Amigos** define feature files:
* Developer (DEV)
* Tester (QA)
* Product Owner (PO)

Example feature file, `computer_search.feature`:

BDD aims to narrow the communication gaps between team members, foster better understanding of the customer and promote continuous communication with real world examples.

* express problems using the language of the domain stakeholders
* this language is then bound to code

Stakeholders often donâ€™t actually create the scenarios, but developers usually do.

**Let behaviour drive your software architecture**

Imagine you see your system as a black box and design all acceptance tests from an outside perspecitve:

* all past PBIs are verified in each software build
* refactor software without breaking the system
* be the first customer of your software (black-box tests)
* better user experience on an API level (UX)
* make your system more accessible by providing the right API endpoints for easier testing

This black-box driven developent process ultimatively leads to a better software architecture.

## So let's get started

```
# start docker container
cd functions/ComputerSearch
docker build --tag computer-search .
docker run -it -p 8001:80 computer-search

# execute acceptance tests
cd features/computer_search
pipenv install
behave
```



The output:
